    "A set of reference images can be used to form a basis set of eigenimages.  Each eigenimage is an orthogonal direction from which the images differ from the the mean image.  Then, a linear combination of these eigenimages can be formed that reconstructs a given target image by projecting the target image onto the basis set.  If a set of M refrence images is used to construct N $\\le$ M eigenimages, then a target image can be reconstructed using appropriately weighted K eigenimages. image1 = (23% of E1) + (2% of E2) + (51% of E3) + ... + (1% En).  Dimensionality reduction is acheived in that K $\\lt$ N. \n",
